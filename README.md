After two years of experience as a PL/SQL developer and supporter for
Accenture, I came to Scotland to improve my English skills. I worked in a
hotel and after that, I decided to embark on a new IT experience working as a
Service Desk Consultant.
Recently, I have gained an interest in gaming development and C++
programming, and I am increasing my knowledge in these areas.
